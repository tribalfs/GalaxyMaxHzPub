<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Appear on top notification for GMH can not be disabled on OneUI4.0</b><br>
I think this a bug on OneUI4.0. Also occurs to other apps. Workaround is to disable appear on top notification for ALL apps (i.e. long-click on the notification and switch off "All Notifications" instead of the app")<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Why this app requires Accessibility Service permission?</b><br>
The general reason is that it's for better stability of some features requiring background service but it is not required if you are not using those - you can turn it off. This is most specially needed when you set min hz to lower than 60hz in adaptive mode to override samsung's implementation which use 60hz min hz as default (see <b>How the Adaptive refresh rate mod works? </b>section below<b>)</b>.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>I am on adaptive or high refresh rate mode, but why my refresh rate stays at 60hz on google maps, waze and some other apps and games even if I set a higher max refresh rate?</b><br>
These apps are either (1) blacklisted by the android system to not use the high refresh rates due to compatibility reasons, (2) sets its own preferred refresh rate or (2) controlled by Samsung's game optimizing service (game launcher). GMH app can't force these apps to use high refresh rates.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>How does Quick-Doze Mod work?</b><br>
If enabled, the device will quickly enter into doze mode (except when charging) while screen is OFF. This will make a better standby power consumption. Motion detection will not interrupt this doze mod. While in doze, the device periodically enters a maintenance window (MW), during which apps can complete pending work (syncs, jobs, etc.). The device will continue this cycle, doubling the length MW interval each time. The longer the MW interval, the better the battery saving.<br>
<br>
Doze mode may cause notification delays on some apps. It will not affect SMS, High Priority FCM and apps which battery optimizations are disabled.<br>
<br>
Doze mode will deactivate once the device is unlocked.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">Caution: Ensure to disable Doze Mods from other apps (if you have it) when enabling this feature in GMH to avoid conflict or clash .</span></li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Why I don't have 48hz and/or 96hz on my device?</b><br>
Availability of certain refresh rates is dependent on hardware support and must also be enabled by manufacturer in the system.<br>
<br>
Currently only the following Samsung devices have 48Hz and/or 96hz enabled:<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Note 20 Ultra (48 &amp; 96)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">S21 Series (48 &amp; 96)</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">S20 series excluding FE (48 &amp; 96 -<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)"> but 48hz was removed by Samsung in OneUI3.1 update on some models)</span></li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Z Flip3</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Z Fold 3</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>How the Adaptive refresh rate mod works? </b><br>
For those devices that do NOT have the Samsung's native Adaptive refresh rate mode, GMH's own Adaptive Mod is applied.<br>
<br>
For those devices which already support Samsung's native adaptive refresh rate, the native adaptive refresh rate is applied 'AS IS' (meaning controlled by the samsung's implementation) even if you you changed the max/peak refresh rate. An exception is when you set/force the minimum refresh for adaptive to lower than 60Hz (e.g. 48hz) - in this case, GMH own adaptive mod implementation is applied. .<br>
<br>
GMH Adaptive mod not only detects touches but also the changes on the contents being displayed on screen similar to Samsung's native adaptive implementation. It is a goal of this app to make the Adaptive mod behavior similar to the native one.<br>
<br>
Some users experienced flickers when refresh rate switches more specifically under low brightness conditions and specially when using 96hz and/or 48hz. This an issue of consistency of gamma curves across the different refresh rates, a display calibration issue and our eyes are more sensitive to it on darker environment. This varies on how finely the manufacturer calibrated the display. It's an issue that GMH can't solve directly. However, you can use GMH minimum brightness threshold for adaptive mod in the app to automatically pause GMH adaptive mod behavior when screen brightness falls below the set brightness threshold.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>In Adaptive refresh rate mod, I set minimum refresh rate to 48Hz but while watching videos, refresh rate only goes down to 60Hz</b><br>
On video apps like youtube, the default refresh rate is set to 60Hz but it will automatically go down to 48Hz on compatible videos (i.e 24fps or 48fps videos). Most videos in youtube are in 60fps format.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Adaptive mod does not go down on GAMES.</b><br>
On games, the refresh rate will be set to the highest refresh rate the game supports and will be fixed on that refresh rate. This is to preserve input responsiveness and smoothness while playing. If the game is not compatible to the currently set max Hz, it will use the next lower compatible refresh rate.<br>
<br>
Important Notes:<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">When you are using "Priority Mode" in Game Launcher, you should add GMH to the <u>excluded list</u> in order to keep it's background service from being killed when opening a game. Not adding GMH to this list can cause refresh rates to drop to minimum hz and behave abnormally while gaming.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">If you are using a third party overlay app that launches when a game is opened (e.g. game monitoring/performance apps), it may cause issue on GMH's game detection that causes refresh rate to not being fixed. If you are experiencing such, please let me know the overlay app that you are using so I can add it in the ignore list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Can I disable appear on top permission if I don't use the app's refresh rate monitor overlay?</b><br>
Not recommended. Disabling it may introduce issues on GMH's Adaptive mod. It's recommended to keep it enabled and just hide its notification by long-pressing on it in the notification panel and switching it off.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Can I add the CQHD+(custom QHD) resolution that supports 96hz/120hz for Note20 Ultra or S20 series device?</b><br>
Yes, this option is added as requested by some users. If it's not shown in the app, just click the "Reload Profile" in the 3-dot menu while connected to the internet to load profiles from my backend containing such resolution. The backend copies of the <i>resolution and refresh profiles </i>have the following additional resolution:<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Note 20 Ultra: 3087x1439 @ 48/60/96/120 hz</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">S20/S20+/S20Ultra: 3180x1431 @ 60/96/120 hz<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47)"><span style="font-family: 'arial'"><b>Caution!! Since OneUI4.0, CQHD causes display to shrink after reboot or long sleep that causes difficulty on unlocking the device.</b></span></span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>I enabled Power Saving Mode on Screen-off and the Always on Display (AOD) stopped working?</b><br>
Disable "Turn-off Always on Display" option in your device's Power Saving Mode settings.<br>
Note: You can use this setting to confirm that PSM on Screen Off is working. AOD turn off after 6-10 seconds.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Refresh Rate freezes after a long idle while using adative mod </b><br>
Ensure that you allow background activities on GMH or allow it's ignore battery optimization requedt. If still persist, you can try adding it to never sleeping apps. If you are using Priority Mode in Game Launcher, add GMH to the excluded list.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>I constantly receive sound/vibration alerts everytime real-time refresh and/or netspeed indicator is turned-on. How can I turn it off?</b><br>
In case you're experiencing this, you can turn this off in the app's notification settings (long press app icon &gt; app info &gt; notifications &gt; open each notif category and set to silent). This is fixed since v6.62.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>How to setup GMH with </b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="ugc nofollow ugc noopener"><b>Tasker</b></a><b>?</b><ol>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>If I uninstall the app, will it restore the phone to its stock settings. </b><br>
Yes, just set back the max hz to the default one and disable all screen off mods before uninstalling.</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Why is it that when I enable Auto SENSORS OFF, the notification panels gets expanded very quickly every time I unlock the device ?</b><br>
Since the api behind android's SENSORS OFF feature is highly restricted and inaccessible by 3rd party on stock roms, GMH's Auto SENSORS OFF option is implemented using touch simulations on the Sensors Off tile which require the notification panel to be expanded when switching this tile on and off. Thus, requiring to put the SENSORS OFF tile within the first 4 positions.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b>Can you make Auto SENSORS OFF deactivate when the screen turns on instead of device unlock so that it deactivates immediately when receiving calls?</b><br>
